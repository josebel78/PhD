## Usage

At present, there are three files in the repository:

- PhD-Paper-01-Cal.ipynb: This notebokk is intended to be used with the following datasets:
	- debug: This folder contains a reduced number of datasets which can be used to debug the code.
	- cal: This folder contains the instances selected to calibrate the GRASP algorithm.

- PhD-Paper-01-Test.ipynb: This notebook is intended to be used with the following datasets:
	- test_small: This folder contains the small instances to test the calibrated GRASP algorithm.
	- test_large: This folder contains the large instances to test the calibrated GRASP algorithm.

- PhD-Paper-01-Eval.ipynb: This notebook is intended to be used with the following directories:
	- test_small: This folder contains the output data that will be used to generate the figures and tables describing the performance of the GRASP algorithm with the small instances.
	- test_large: This folder contains the outpust data that will be used to generate the figures and tables describing the performance of the GRASP algorithm with the large instances.
